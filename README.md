A fairly simple but functional day calender

Good morning! Today I have for you what is essentially a single day planner. Unfortunately, while the code is operational it is certainly lacking in a lot of features that say Google calender would have to offer? Well in short it's not really for you. This was an invaluable exercise in learning Jquery and further additional practice for me in writing code.

There are a ton of directions that you could go from here and I think the next step I take is to create multiple days and attach a month/year. There is a mayor limitation on this being something you can only do for a single day. I guess there could be some virtue for recurring appointments. Additionally it being only one day also limits the usefulness of the color changing nature of the project.
